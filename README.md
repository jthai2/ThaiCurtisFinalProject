What we created was 3 games that you could choose from. One was ObstacleCourse, another was War, and the last one was TicTacToe. We created these because we wanted to give options to choose from instead of just one game. War is the card game where the cards are divided up evenly and each player gets 26 cards. The player with the highest cards takes the cards. ObstacleCourse is a set of 10 questions to get through, and if you get one wrong, you would need to start over to the first question. TicTacToe is self explanatory. An obstacle was that we would add up the scores, but the score would get deleted because we ran the program instead of the method. Another obstacle was me not able to come up with questions. One thing we enjoyed was the satisfication of completing the programs.
